# Effective Notetaking

## Introduction

Knowing what to expect is a vital factor in getting the most from both books and lecturers.

Being a successful student is far more about being a smart user of effective strategies than about being smart.

You need to understand:

- Why it works
- How it works
- When it works
- When it doesn't
- How to use it effectively

You also need to understand your own learning style, to help you assess whether a particular strategy is right for *you*.

The effective and long-term use of any memory strategy requires 2 things:

- that you understand why and how and when the strategy works, and
- that you practice the strategy enough to achieve mastery
