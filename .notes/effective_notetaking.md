# Effective Notetaking

## 1. Introduction

Knowing what to expect is a vital factor in getting the most from both books and lecturers.

Being a successful student is far more about being a smart user of effective strategies than about being smart.

You need to understand:

- Why it works
- How it works
- When it works
- When it doesn't
- How to use it effectively

You also need to understand your own learning style, to help you assess whether a particular strategy is right for *you*.

The effective and long-term use of any memory strategy requires 2 things:

- that you understand why and how and when the strategy works, and
- that you practice the strategy enough to achieve mastery

The distinction between note-taking and active reading is somewhat arbitrary. Reading actively often involves taking notes; taking notes often requires you to read. One such strategy involves activating prior knowledge in preparation for reading about/taking notes about a subject. This is called priming, and it really does help, especially when the subject matter is difficult or unfamiliar.

# 2. Making note-taking an effective strategy

Sometimes note-taking helps you remember information, and sometimes it doesn't.

Note-taking != Note-making

We take notes from books and lectures (much more difficult), we make notes as preparation for an essay or presentation or exam, to clarify our thoughts.

The act of note-taking is about how to encode information in your brain, not necessarily remembering. For that, it is important to:

- Paraphrase
- Organize
- Make sense of the information

Unless used as a stepping stone *verbatim notes* are quite useless.

Several factors for effective note-taking:

- density
- style
- organization
- skill

In the case of lectures, information should be presented more slowly.

Personality matters, but effective methods are effective regardless of the person.

However, one factor that should be paramount to the discussion is your limits in terms of working memory capacity.

## The Importance of Working Memory Capacity

WMC correlates highly with fluid intelligence (fluid intelligence refers to general reasoning and problem-solving abilities, while crystallized intelligence refers to cognitive functions associated with knowledge).

In fact, a study found that a sutendt's ability to take good notes and benefit from them is better predicted by his working memory than by his grade point average.

Part of it is making inferences, which requires holding connections in our WM.

Indications are that students with a low working memory capacity use less effective strategies when reading because such strategies are less demanding.

## What Working Memory Is

**To put information into our long-term memory store, we must encode it**, which means, for the most part, we must actively process it, work on it. This we term being "in working memory". Essentially, being in working memory is a way of saying information is currently being worked on.

Similarly, when we retrieve information &mdash; get it out of the memory store / "remember" it &mdash; the information again passes through this state of consciousness, this working memory.

Our long-term memory store is incredibly large, but the amount we can process at any one time is very small.

## Working memory capacity and the magic number seven

Current research is actually converging at 4+-1 and not 7+-2 as it used to be believed. And only one item of them can be in your full focus at any one time. But it also seems likely you can also hold another 3 or so items in a state of readiness, ready to jump into working memory.

That said, 1 through 7 could either be individual chunks or a single abstraction chunk.

What may be more important is how long it takes you to say the words &mdash; information is usually held in working memory in the form of an acoustic, sound-based, code. It appears that you can only hold in WM what you can say in 1.5-2 seconds. Slow speakers are therefore penalized. This also explains why we tend to talk very fast when we have a lot of information we want to disgorge.

## There's more than one working memory

Domain-specific WM are still debated, however there is reasonable consensus that verbal and visuospatial information have different stores. This is important because it means you can increase the amount of information you're currently holding by using both systems. But the most important part of working memory, it now appears, is the executive control &mdash; your ability to control attention; your ability to concentrate and not be distracted by competing demands.

## Working memory is about attention

We tend to focus on the more deliberate concentration ability when we think of attention, but these two aspects of attention are both important, and indeed, it may be that the ability to ignore irrelevant information is the more important. In fact, it may be that WM capacity is *only* critical when there's inference.

Emotions can be highly distracting.

Most importantly and least obviously, conflicting, inconsistent, or merely different, information is a source of interference. For example, holding your goal in mind, is a possible source of interference.

Think of information gathering as rolling a snowball. As long as the information all sticks together in a coherent, consistent, meaningful ball, you're fine.

The cognitive load is the extent to which the material makes demands on working memory. There are 2 parts to it:

- intrinsic (how dificult the material is)
- Extrinsic (how it's presented)

Research suggests that the format of the material is only important when the intrinsic load is high.
