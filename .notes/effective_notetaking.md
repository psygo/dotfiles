# Effective Notetaking

## 1. Introduction

Knowing what to expect is a vital factor in getting the most from both books and lecturers.

Being a successful student is far more about being a smart user of effective strategies than about being smart.

You need to understand:

- Why it works
- How it works
- When it works
- When it doesn't
- How to use it effectively

You also need to understand your own learning style, to help you assess whether a particular strategy is right for *you*.

The effective and long-term use of any memory strategy requires 2 things:

- that you understand why and how and when the strategy works, and
- that you practice the strategy enough to achieve mastery

The distinction between note-taking and active reading is somewhat arbitrary. Reading actively often involves taking notes; taking notes often requires you to read. One such strategy involves activating prior knowledge in preparation for reading about/taking notes about a subject. This is called priming, and it really does help, especially when the subject matter is difficult or unfamiliar.

# 2. Making note-taking an effective strategy

Sometimes note-taking helps you remember information, and sometimes it doesn't.

Note-taking != Note-making

We take notes from books and lectures (much more difficult), we make notes as preparation for an essay or presentation or exam, to clarify our thoughts.

The act of note-taking is about how to encode information in your brain, not necessarily remembering. For that, it is important to:

- Paraphrase
- Organize
- Make sense of the information

Unless used as a stepping stone *verbatim notes* are quite useless.

Several factors for effective note-taking:

- density
- style
- organization
- skill

In the case of lectures, information should be presented more slowly.

Personality matters, but effective methods are effective regardless of the person.

However, one factor that should be paramount to the discussion is your limits in terms of working memory capacity.

## The Importance of Working Memory Capacity

WMC correlates highly with fluid intelligence (fluid intelligence refers to general reasoning and problem-solving abilities, while crystallized intelligence refers to cognitive functions associated with knowledge).

In fact, a study found that a sutendt's ability to take good notes and benefit from them is better predicted by his working memory than by his grade point average.

Part of it is making inferences, which requires holding connections in our WM.

Indications are that students with a low working memory capacity use less effective strategies when reading because such strategies are less demanding.

## What Working Memory Is

**To put information into our long-term memory store, we must encode it**, which means, for the most part, we must actively process it, work on it. This we term being "in working memory". Essentially, being in working memory is a way of saying information is currently being worked on.

Similarly, when we retrieve information &mdash; get it out of the memory store / "remember" it &mdash; the information again passes through this state of consciousness, this working memory.

Our long-term memory store is incredibly large, but the amount we can process at any one time is very small.

## Working memory capacity and the magic number seven

Current research is actually converging at 4+-1 and not 7+-2 as it used to be believed. And only one item of them can be in your full focus at any one time. But it also seems likely you can also hold another 3 or so items in a state of readiness, ready to jump into working memory.

That said, 1 through 7 could either be individual chunks or a single abstraction chunk.

What may be more important is how long it takes you to say the words &mdash; information is usually held in working memory in the form of an acoustic, sound-based, code. It appears that you can only hold in WM what you can say in 1.5-2 seconds. Slow speakers are therefore penalized. This also explains why we tend to talk very fast when we have a lot of information we want to disgorge.

## There's more than one working memory

Domain-specific WM are still debated, however there is reasonable consensus that verbal and visuospatial information have different stores. This is important because it means you can increase the amount of information you're currently holding by using both systems. But the most important part of working memory, it now appears, is the executive control &mdash; your ability to control attention; your ability to concentrate and not be distracted by competing demands.

## Working memory is about attention

We tend to focus on the more deliberate concentration ability when we think of attention, but these two aspects of attention are both important, and indeed, it may be that the ability to ignore irrelevant information is the more important. In fact, it may be that WM capacity is *only* critical when there's inference.

Emotions can be highly distracting.

Most importantly and least obviously, conflicting, inconsistent, or merely different, information is a source of interference. For example, holding your goal in mind, is a possible source of interference.

Think of information gathering as rolling a snowball. As long as the information all sticks together in a coherent, consistent, meaningful ball, you're fine.

The cognitive load is the extent to which the material makes demands on working memory. There are 2 parts to it:

- intrinsic (how dificult the material is)
- Extrinsic (how it's presented)

Research suggests that the format of the material is only important when the intrinsic load is high.

# Selection Strategies

> Anything that helps you select the most important information is good.

Distinguishing the important from the unimportant information is arguably the most critical skill in successful studying. Unfortunately, no one has yet come up with an effective way of teaching this skill.

(...) You do, however, need a certain degree of background knowledge. This is why most students take lots of notes when they are new to the subject and become more selective with time. It's also why it helps to read relevant material before a lecture.

There are a number of strategies which may be considered selection strategies:

- highlighting
- headings
- summaries

## Highlighting Important Information

Highlighting also depends on the person doing the highlighting having the same goals as you.

Highlighting important terms is better than nothing, but quite excessive anyway. More colors might help in creating a layered database, but it might also overload your brain anyway.

Dense material, which end up requiring too much highlighting should actually be accompanied by a notebook.

> The text on Benjamin Franklin is actually quite interesting. Franklin was a dubious man.

It's hard to know what's important when you don't know what you're supposed to be interested in. A specific purpose &mdash; a goal &mdash; makes it much easier.

Highlighting causes you to direct more attention to the selected words. Such words are more likely to be recalled. However, there are a number of provisos:

- If the material is familiar to you, it won't be affected by the highlighting.
- If the text is brief, particular details won't be helped by highlighting.
- Highlighting should be simple, using different methods doesn't necessarily improve the result but might actually harm it.

In other words, you should only highlight details you don't already know, and only when the text is long enough to benefit from it.

**Highlighting acts to direct attention. It doesn't improve recall as such, what it does is improve recall of those parts highlighted &mdash; at the expense of the rest of the text. It is therefore vital that the right information be highlighted.**

### What Should Be Highlightet?

Selection can be a problem when the teacher or writer is doing the highlighting, because the details that should be selected will be different depending on the goals of the reader and their familiarity with the material.

> If almost all the material is highlighted, what's actually being highlighted is the text that's not highlighted.

- Restrict highlighting to at most 10% of the text &mdash; one line in 10
- Select those details that you want to remember, and *don't think you will*.
- In information-dense text, or where the text is difficult, use highlighting only as an adjunct to other strategies.
- Highlighting is also likely to be ineffective when you are working under severe time constraints.

The main value of highlighting (as a strategy) appears to lie in its encouragement to spend more time with the material. It also helps in aiding concentration.

## Headings highlight structure

Placing summarized headings on a complex text might help you get a better top-bottom view of its contents.

The presence of headings has been found to produce better summaries, better outlines, and better memory for the main points of a text.

> Headings are organizational signals. Other organizational signals are overviews and topical summaries.

Headings usually help readers remember *more topics, but less about each topic*.

A comparison of the effects of an overview, a topical summary, and headings, found no difference in the amount of information remembered without specific prompts (free recall).

However, signalizng doesn't always help your ability to recall information. It seems it actually also isn't very helpful when it comes to recognition (which is the type of memory you may be relying on in multi-choice tests).

## How do headings help memory?

**How easily you remember details you've read in a text depends heavily on the degree to which the details have been integrated with the rest of the material.** In expository texts, the connection between items is usually less predictable.

The difficulty you experience in remembering a text is directly a consequence of the extent to which the information flows in a "logical" order. (That's probably why large stories, like the Odyssey, could still be repeated by so many people trhoughout all Greece.)

You can counteract the failure of many texts to provide headings, or to provide effective headings, by using a topic structure strategy. Organizational signals like headings appear to help recall by encouraging you to choose the more effective topic structure strategy. They do this by emphasizing the transitions between topics, and by articulating the topics, that is, summing them up in a pithy phrase.

## Learning to use the topic structure strategy

Different types of text structure:

1. Description: extension or clarification of main ideas through explanations, examples, or information about attributes. *in particular, for instance, for example, is defined*
1. Collections: a list of facts or elements. *in addition to, and, and, a number of, many, one, two, three*
1. Classification: where items are grouped in classes. *belongs to, types, classes, categories, group*
1. Sequence: a connecting series of events or steps, possibly causally related. *first, second... finally, therefore, consequently, the next, if... then, leads, to, causes, because*
1. Comparison: where two or more things are compared or contrasted. *likewise, similarly, same, in comparison*
1. Problem: discussion of a problem and its solution, or a question and its answer. (Comparison: *likewise, similarly, same, in comparison*, Contrast: *in contrast, but, on the other hand, on the contrary, different*)

The text structure:

- cues you to what is important
- helps you ask the right questions
- tells you how the ideas in the text are related
- provides a structure for your notes
- cues you to the best format for your notes.

> The consolidation text on page ~42-45 is quite nice when it comes to understanding better how memories move around the brain.

### A further effect of signals

Remembering is not only about putting information in; it's also about getting it out again. Signals also are potentially helpful in recalling.

When there are no signals, recall tends to be strongly affected by standard memory factors such as:

- serial position
- familiarity
- elaboration

In other words, if you don’t use the text structure to encode and recall the information, you’re most likely to preferentially remember the information that you already knew, information that appeared at the start or end of the text, and information that was discussed a lot.

Characteristics of a skilled reader

Skilled readers demonstrate their sensitivity to topic structure in
several ways:

- they read topic-introducing sentences more slowly
- they read topic sentences that are difficult to relate to the topic more slowly1
- they recall more superordinate items than subordinate (e.g., categories rather than category members).

> Headings != Topics. Headings talk about the text itself, while topics might be definitions, classifications, etc.

### Readiness to think

The pleasure you take in engaging your mind

It's assumed that this occurs because students who readily engage in effortful processing are more inclined to use the structure strategy when confronted with a text without signals.

It has also been suggested that headings only help when students already have a high knowledge of the subject discussed in the text. This is consistent with the theory that headings work by activating prior knowledge.

Headings may, however, have other benefits for students with little prior knowledge &mdash; in helping them organize the information contained in the text, and in helping them search for specific items

When are headings most useful?

- When the text has several topics and is not clearly organized.
- When other cues to the structure of the text and the relative importance of details aren’t available.
- When the reader needs assistance in understanding the organization of the text, or the relative importance of details.

# 5. Summaries

> Summarizing is the heart of note-taking.

Summaries you create != summaries that are given to you

Different types:

- Topical: summarize the main points without adding any new information, this is usually provided after the text.
- Outlines, graphic organizers, multimedia, maps: usually provided after sections of text.
- Overview: usually given before the text.

Summaries are a great priming tool.

The first step in taking notes is not to read the text, but to prepare yourself for it.

> It's difficult to prime yourself when you have 3-5 lectures in a row to attend to everyday.

**What do you need to know?**

If there's no summary at the beginning, maybe there's one at the end. Maybe reading it first is the right way to go.

Advance organizers are typically written at a higher level of abstraction, it's less detailed. Overviews, like summaries, say nothing that is not in the text; advance organizers do.

Interestingly, it seems that the benefit of an advance organizer is greter if students don't read the text immediately after reading the organizer, but have a short delay before doing so.

- A topical summary is a straightforward string of factual statements.
- Topical summaries summarize the main points without adding any new
- information or offering a new perspective.
- Topical summaries have the same functions and disadvantages as headings.
- An overview is a topical summary that precedes the text.
- Overviews make it easier to read and understand text.
- Like overviews, advance organizers precede the text.
- Advance organizers are concerned with the big picture.
- Advance organizers help you connect new facts and ideas to knowledge you already have.

## Creating Summaries

Although summarizing is an effective strategy for learning from text, it’s been estimated that perhaps half of all college students can’t do it effectively.

A good summary:

- is short
- contains only, and all, the most important information
- is in your own words

Identifying or creating topic sentences is a critical part of summarizing, and it is the most difficult

1. delete trivial material
1. delete redundant material
1. replace lists of items with a superordinate term
1. select a topic sentence
1. if no topic sentence given, create one

Clearly, the most difficult part is the last one.

## Summarizing step-by-step

If there's no summary or headings, you could start by skimming the text. Skimming involves looking for *signal* words and phrases, skipping all the information that provides background or supporting information.

**Don't summarize as you go, do it after the text**

**The best summaries are made without reference to the text.**

Check that the idea you had while priming is the same after you read the text, if not, update it.

It may be that the text has confused you. You thought you knew what the theme of the text was; now, drowning in details, you’re not sure. If you’re having trouble figuring out the main idea, look for repetition &mdash; references that are repeated throughout the text. How often a writer refers to an idea is a good clue to how important she thinks it is. Also look for opportunities for generalization. If there are lists of items, categorize them. Sometimes the main idea is hidden among the details.

Once you’ve worked out the main idea of the text, you need to identify the supporting ideas. Do that by grouping together paragraphs on the same topic and labelling them.

Even if the ideas are described clearly in a single sentence, you should still try to put in your own words — only then will you know you understand it.

The checklist:

- Have you stated the main idea of the passage?
- Do you have all the important information?
- Have you included any information that is not important?
- Is it in your own words?

The most difficult part of this process is certainly constructing the main idea when it isn’t succinctly expressed in a single topic sentence — remember, this is the step that even college students managed only half the time. The part students find easiest is deleting the unimportant information7

> **To summarize effectively requires you to look beyond the surface words &mdash; to understand the text in more abstract terms than those in which the text is expressed.**

It’s worth noting, too, that summarizing after a delay has been shown to be dramatically more effective in terms of the student understanding how well they’ve learned the material.

Rules for more effective summarizing:

1. Preview and reflect
1. Read
1. Identify the main idea, and put it in your own words (without looking at the text)
1. Identify the important supporting ideas, and put them in your own words
1. Check

> Google minor details you're missing and that are impairing you from answering the big questions.

You are not trying to record everything you read / hear — you are recording what you need help to remember.

Repetition of words is an indication of importance.

> **This is a useful lesson, and points to something you should take to heart: the
less you understand, the fuller your notes will tend to be — because you can’t
tell what’s important and what’s not. The more you understand, the more
scanty your notes will be — because you have captured the gist, you have
recorded only what is important.**
