# Philippe Fanaro's Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Linux, I focus a lot on minimalism. Anyway, I currently use:

- Konsole as my terminal &mdash; mostly because it supports font ligatures
- Neovim
- Emacs &mdash; [Doom Emacs][doom_emacs] &mdash;, mostly for some notes in Org-mode &mdash; might fully transition from [Notion][notion]
- [XMonad][xmonad] as a Window Manager
- ~~dmenu~~ `XMonad.Prompt` as an application launcher
- ranger as an in-terminal file manager
- Nemo as my GUI file manager
- Brave as my default browser

I also have some custom command-line programs which help create a more modern environment, like Rust's [`exa`][exa] and [`bat`][bat].


[bat]: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
[doom_emacs]: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs
[exa]: https://github.com/ogham/exa
[notion]: https://notion.so/
[xmonad]: https://xmonad.org/

## Improvements to the Setup

- [ ] Reach VS Code-like productivity in Vim
- [ ] Check out `xcape` for another layer of shortcuts
- [X] Go through the major topics of [Greg Hurrel's screen casts][greg_hurrel_sc]
