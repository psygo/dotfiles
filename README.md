# Philippe Fanaro's Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Linux, I focus a lot on minimalism. Anyway, I currently use:

- Konsole as my terminal &mdash; mostly because it supports font ligatures
- Neovim
- Emacs, mostly for some notes in Org-mode &mdash; might fully transition from [Notion][notion]
- [XMonad][xmonad] as a Window Manager
- ~~dmenu~~ `XMonad.Prompt` as an application launcher
- ranger as an in-terminal file manager
- Nemo as my GUI file manager
- Brave as my default browser

I also have some custom command-line programs which help create a more modern environment, like Rust's [`exa`][exa] and [`bat`][bat].
