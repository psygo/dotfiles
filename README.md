# Philippe's Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Linux, I currently use:

- Konsole as my terminal &mdash; mostly because it supports font ligatures
- Neovim
- Emacs, mostly for some notes in Org-mode &mdash; might fully transition from [Notion][notion]
- XMonad as a Window Manager
- dmenu as an application launcher
- ranger as an in-terminal file manager
- Nemo as my GUI file manager
- Brave as my default browser
